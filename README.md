# Inventory-Analysis---Power-BI
Problem Statement: Inventory Analysis Using Power BI
Effective inventory management is critical for businesses to minimize costs, avoid stockouts, and ensure timely product availability. Traditional inventory tracking methods often lack real-time insights and data visualization, making it difficult for decision-makers to optimize stock levels and forecast demand accurately.

This Inventory Analysis using Power BI aims to:

Visualize inventory trends across products, categories, and locations in real-time.
Analyze stock turnover rates, slow-moving items, and identify excess inventory.
Forecast demand using historical data, ensuring optimal stock levels.
Identify understock and overstock patterns to improve order planning and supplier management.
Generate actionable insights for improving supply chain efficiency, reducing carrying costs, and increasing profitability.
By integrating real-time data feeds and creating interactive dashboards, this solution provides stakeholders with comprehensive insights, enabling them to make informed, data-driven decisions to optimize inventory performance.
